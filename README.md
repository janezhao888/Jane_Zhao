The file "R_code_for_imputation.txt" contains the R script for the phenotype/trait imputation method utilizing a copula model, 
as detailed in our manuscript titled "A novel phenotype imputation method with copula model."
For demonstration purposes, we have included the "data.csv" file in the script. This dataset features 25 missing values (NA) 
in the third phenotype. Utilize the R script within "R_code_for_imputation.txt" to impute values for these 25 missing entries.
The script offers three loss functions: square loss (MSE), 0-1 loss, and quantile loss. Currently, we employ the quantile loss function. 
Feel free to choose the loss function that best suits your requirements. if you have any questions, please contact Jane Zhao at jane.zhao001@mymdc.net
